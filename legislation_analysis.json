  "summary": "Here is a final summary of the Universal Credit Act 2025:\n\n*   **Purpose:** The Universal Credit Act 2025 primarily aims to restructure Universal Credit and Employment and Support Allowance rates, mandating specific annual increases for the UC standard allowance and introducing new frameworks for the Limited Capability for Work and Work-Related Activity (LCWRA) element.\n*   **Definitions:** Key new definitions include \"pre-2026 claimants\" (those continuously receiving LCWRA before April 6, 2026) and \"Severe Conditions Criteria (SCC) claimants,\" characterized by specific lifelong, professionally diagnosed conditions meeting Schedule 7 descriptors. The \"relevant CPI percentage\" for up-rating is based on the September Consumer Prices Index.\n*   **Eligibility:** Eligibility for LCWRA will now be tiered, with a new, lower amount for claimants not categorized as \"pre-2026,\" \"SCC,\" or \"terminally ill.\" SCC claimants must demonstrate a lifelong, constant, professionally diagnosed condition fulfilling specific criteria.\n*   **Obligations:** The Act mandates annual increases for the Universal Credit standard allowance and the combined protected LCWRA/standard allowance (based on CPI and uplift percentages) for tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30. Similar CPI-based up-rating applies to specific legacy ESA components, while the annual up-rating of LCWRA and LCW elements is generally frozen during this period. These obligations apply to both Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n*   **Enforcement & Assessments:** New assessment rules for SCC claimants limit further reviews once a determination is made, unless \"relevant evidence\" (e.g., material factual error, significant change) is presented. The Act also suspends general annual up-rating provisions for certain components, with all these changes taking effect from April 6, 2026.",
