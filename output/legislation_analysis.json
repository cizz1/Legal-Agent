  "summary": "Here is a final summary of the provided sub-summaries:\n\n*   **Purpose:** The Universal Credit Act 2025 aims to modify and mandate specific annual increases for Universal Credit (UC) and certain legacy Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) payment rates, including the standard allowance and the Limited Capability for Work (LCW) and Work-Related Activity (LCWRA) elements.\n*   **Obligations (UC Standard Allowance & Combined):** It mandates annual increases for the UC standard allowance for tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and additional uplift percentages, overriding standard up-rating provisions. The combined protected LCWRA amount and standard allowance must also increase annually by the relevant CPI percentage.\n*   **Obligations (Legacy ESA & LCW/LCWRA Freezes):** Specific legacy ESA components (personal allowance, disability premium, support component) must also be up-rated annually by the relevant CPI percentage for 2026-2030. Conversely, the annual up-rating of both the LCW and LCWRA elements is frozen for these same tax years.\n*   **Definitions & Eligibility (Claimant Categories):** The Act introduces new LCWRA element amounts, differentiated by claimant categories. Key definitions include \"pre-2026 claimants\" (those continuously receiving LCWRA before April 6, 2026) and \"Severe Conditions Criteria (SCC) claimants.\" The \"relevant CPI percentage\" is defined as the year-on-year increase in the Consumer Prices Index for September.\n*   **Definitions & Eligibility (SCC Claimants):** An SCC claimant is defined as an individual with LCWRA whose lifelong, constantly applicable, professionally diagnosed bodily or mental condition meets specific Schedule 7 descriptors. A new, lower LCWRA amount is introduced for claimants who do not fall into the \"pre-2026,\" \"severe conditions criteria,\" or \"terminally ill\" categories.\n*   **Enforcement & Assessment Rules:** Once an SCC claimant determination is made, no further assessment will be carried out unless \"relevant evidence\" (e.g., a material factual error or significant change) emerges. These provisions, including changes to assessment rules and information requirements, come into force on April 6, 2026, with corresponding mandates for Northern Ireland.",
