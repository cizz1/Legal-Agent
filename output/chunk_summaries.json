    "Here's a summary of the text in 3 bullet points:\n\n*   The Universal Credit Act 2025 aims to alter the rates of the standard allowance, Limited Capability for Work (LCW) element, and Limited Capability for Work and Work-Related Activity (LCWRA) element of Universal Credit, as well as income-related Employment and Support Allowance.\n*   It mandates specific annual increases for the Universal Credit standard allowance for tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30, calculated based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and additional uplift percentages, overriding standard annual up-rating provisions.\n*   From April 2026, a new LCWRA element amount (\u00a3217.26) is introduced for certain claimant categories, while simultaneously freezing the annual up-rating of both the LCWRA and LCW elements for the tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30.",
    "Here's a summary of the text in 3\u20134 bullet points:\n\n*   The Universal Credit Act 2025 mandates that the combined sum of the protected LCWRA amount and the standard allowance for Universal Credit must be increased annually by the relevant Consumer Prices Index (CPI) percentage.\n*   For tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30, specific components of legacy Employment and Support Allowance (ESA IR), including the personal allowance, disability premium, and support component, must also be up-rated annually by the relevant CPI percentage.\n*   The \"relevant CPI percentage\" is determined by the year-on-year increase in the Consumer Prices Index for September, and general annual up-rating provisions are suspended for certain ESA IR components during the specified tax years.\n*   The Act also includes corresponding provisions for Northern Ireland and amends the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 to introduce new LCWRA element amounts based on claimant categories (e.g., pre-2026, severe conditions, terminally ill).",
    "Here's a summary of the text in 3\u20134 bullet points:\n\n*   The Universal Credit Regulations 2013 are amended to specify that for couples, the higher LCWRA element is awarded if amounts differ, and to define \"pre-2026 claimants\" as those continuously receiving LCWRA before April 6, 2026.\n*   A new category, \"Severe Conditions Criteria Claimant\" (SCC claimant), is introduced for individuals with Limited Capability for Work and Work-Related Activity (LCWRA) who also have a lifelong, constantly applicable, professionally diagnosed bodily or mental condition.\n*   New rules govern assessments for SCC claimants, limiting further assessments once a determination is made (either as an SCC claimant or not) unless \"relevant evidence\" (e.g., a material factual error or significant change) is presented.",
    "Here's a summary of the text in 3-4 bullet points:\n\n*   The Department for Communities in Northern Ireland is mandated to increase Universal Credit standard allowance amounts for tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30 annually, based on a calculation involving the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and specific uplift percentages for each year.\n*   Amendments to Northern Ireland's Universal Credit Regulations introduce new claimant categories: \"pre-2026 claimant\" (those continuously receiving LCWRA before April 2026) and \"severe conditions criteria claimant.\"\n*   The Limited Capability for Work and Work-Related Activity (LCWRA) element will now be awarded at different rates, with a new, lower amount for claimants who do not fall into the \"pre-2026,\" \"severe conditions criteria,\" or \"terminally ill\" categories.\n*   Regulations concerning information requirements and medical examinations are updated to incorporate the new \"severe conditions criteria claimant\" designation.",
    "Here's a summary of the text in 3\u20134 bullet points:\n\n*   A claimant is designated a \"severe conditions criteria claimant\" if they have limited capability for work and work-related activity, and at least one specific descriptor from Schedule 7 applies constantly and for the rest of their life.\n*   The incapability must arise from a specific bodily disease/disablement or mental illness/disablement, which is lifelong and has been diagnosed by an appropriately qualified healthcare professional.\n*   Once a determination is made regarding a claimant's severe conditions criteria status, no further assessment will be carried out unless \"relevant evidence\" emerges, such as a material factual error in the original determination or a significant change in the claimant's physical or mental condition.\n*   These provisions, including changes to assessment rules and information requirements, come into force on 6 April 2026.",
    "Here's a summary of the text in 3 bullet points:\n\n*   In Northern Ireland, the combined protected LCWRA amount and standard allowance for Universal Credit must be increased annually, ensuring the current tax year's sum is at least the previous year's sum plus the relevant CPI percentage.\n*   For tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30, the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland must similarly increase specific legacy Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) amounts, including the personal allowance and certain disability premiums, by at least the relevant CPI percentage.\n*   The \"relevant CPI percentage\" is calculated based on the year-on-year increase in the Consumer Prices Index for September (or 0% if there is no increase)."
